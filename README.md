# Sitemaps Getter

This is a package built to fetch and parse sitemaps from websites, it currently supports only sitemap.xml files and it errors out at any given error in the sitemap request.

You can find examples in the examples folder, the package is built using Typescript. It also uses Axios due to the better error handling it has, error handling with only fetch was being painful.
